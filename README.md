## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simeon, I bridge my SOC background with cloud security engineering to help organizations detect, contain, and prevent threats in both on-prem and cloud-native infrastructures.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m leveraging Terraform to build, secure, and manage scalable Azure infrastructure.

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m certified in CompTIA Security+, CySA+, and Azure Security Engineer Associate, but I also bring the mindset of an athlete and veteran, Iâ€™ve competed at the highest levels in wrestling and served in the military, training alongside special forces.
I was the first in my family to graduate college and the first state champion in my high schoolâ€™s history, so I know what it means to build something from the ground up.
