## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simeon, I bridge my SOC background with cloud security engineering to help organizations detect, contain, and prevent threats in both on-prem and cloud-native infrastructures.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m leveraging Terraform to build, secure, and manage scalable Azure infrastructure to cut costs and boost efficiency.

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m certified in CompTIA Security+, CySA+, and Azure Security Engineer Associate, but I bring the discipline of an athlete and the leadership of a veteran. Iâ€™ve competed at the highest levels in wrestling, served in the military training alongside Special Forces and Rangers, and became the first state champion in my high schoolâ€™s history. These experiences shaped my ability to perform under pressure, master advanced techniques, and consistently deliver at a high level.
